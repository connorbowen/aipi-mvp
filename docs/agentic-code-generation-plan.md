# Implementation Plan for Autonomous Agentic Code Generation

The goal is to extend the existing Cursor-based NL-to-API platform with an agent that, given a high-level natural-language goal, autonomously **plans and generates a code workflow** (API calls, logic, scheduling, etc.) using the platform's stack (Next.js, Node.js, Prisma/Postgres, and OpenAI function calling). The plan is broken into stages with integration points, example flows, and safety measures:

## 1. Environment Setup

* **Install and configure dependencies**. Ensure the Node/Next.js development environment is ready and that Prisma/PostgreSQL are properly set up. Install the OpenAI Node library and the Vercel AI SDK (or similar) to use function-calling from the server (e.g. [OpenAI function calling with Next.js]).
* **Configure API credentials**. Add the OpenAI API key (and any other API keys) as environment variables. For example, a Next.js API route can initialize the OpenAI client with `process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY`. Similarly, ensure PostgreSQL credentials and Prisma configuration are in place.
* **Prisma schema updates**. Extend the Prisma schema to include new tables for the agent's workflows, steps, and audit logs. For instance, add tables like `Workflows`, `WorkflowSteps`, and `AuditLogs`. This allows persistence of user goals, generated code artifacts, and log entries.

## 2. System Design & Integration

* **Define architecture integration points**. Plan where the agent logic will reside. Likely as a backend module or microservice called by the Next.js API routes. This agent will take user goals from the front end, use OpenAI to generate a plan and code, and output a workflow spec. Integrate with the existing API-ingestion component (which already has OpenAPI specs) by feeding the relevant OpenAPI definitions into the LLM prompts.
* **Convert OpenAPI specs to functions**. Use or build a converter that turns ingested OpenAPI specs into JSON "function" definitions compatible with GPT function calling. (For example, Haystack's `OpenAPIServiceToFunctions` shows how each API path becomes a callable function for OpenAI.) This allows the LLM to "call" any endpoint by name in its generated output. Store these function definitions in a shared format (e.g. JSON) that can be passed to the LLM.
* **Task decomposition planning**. Incorporate a planning step to break the user's goal into sub-tasks. As noted in APIAide, an effective agent must **decompose tasks into coherent API-call sequences** and handle parameterization. In practice, send an initial prompt like "Plan how to accomplish this goal using available APIs and logic," and parse GPT's multi-step plan. Each step may correspond to invoking a certain API or performing logic.
* **Define modular components**. Architect the system into modules (e.g. "Planner", "Code Generator", "Executor"). The Planner agent uses GPT to outline steps (maybe with function-calling to simulate "planning" functions), the Code Generator agent uses GPT to implement each step (emitting code or config), and an optional Reviewer agent checks outputs. This mirrors multi-agent pipelines where one model plans, another codes, and another reviews. Ensure these modules communicate via your existing APIs or a message bus.

## 3. Execution Engine (LLM Workflow)

* **Chain-of-thought planning with GPT**. Implement the core engine that sends prompts to GPT in sequence. For example, first send the user goal + function definitions to GPT with a system prompt "Plan a sequence of API calls and logic steps (with conditions) to achieve this." Parse GPT's response as a JSON "plan." Then, for each planned step, send another prompt to GPT to generate code or call instructions (using function calling to specify API and arguments). This multi-step prompting is like the "Sequential Thinking" pipeline where GPT plans then codes then reviews.
* **Use OpenAI Function Calling for steps**. Leverage OpenAI's function-calling feature so GPT returns a structured plan or code fragment. For instance, define functions like `plan_step()` or `generate_code()` that GPT can "call" by outputting a JSON payload. The system executes the function (which may do nothing but log the output or format it) and feeds the result back to GPT if needed (per the typical function-calling loop). This creates a tight back-and-forth where GPT iteratively refines the plan or code.
* **API call generation**. When generating code, provide GPT with the relevant function definitions (from OpenAPI specs). GPT can output a JSON function call like `{ "name": "callApi", "arguments": { "apiName": "WeatherAPI", "endpoint": "getForecast", ... } }`. The server executes the actual HTTP call (or prepares code to do so). Then send the API response back to GPT to allow it to incorporate results or continue the workflow. This mirrors GPT function-calling patterns.
* **Handle conditionals and loops**. Include logic in the GPT prompts to cover conditionals (e.g. "if X, do Y else Z"). For example, have a prompt instruct GPT to output conditional code in a structured way (perhaps as a JSON AST). The execution engine should then translate those into actual code (if/else in the generated script) or branch logic in the workflow engine. This can be managed by GPT outputting named "function calls" for conditional branches that the backend interprets.
* **Scheduling and orchestration**. If the goal involves scheduling (e.g. "run this daily"), the agent should generate scheduling code. For example, instruct GPT to output a cron expression or use Node's `node-cron` library. The engine could auto-generate code using scheduled jobs or set up serverless triggers (e.g. Vercel Cron). Ensure the execution engine can register such schedules in the platform (e.g. write a record in the database that a background worker or cloud function will run).

## 4. User Confirmation UI

* **Present plans before execution**. After the agent generates a proposed workflow (the sequence of API calls and logic), show this plan to the user in the UI. Use a flow similar to OpenAI's "User Approval" pattern: send an "intent" or summary to the client and ask for confirmation. For example, display the steps as text or a flowchart and have the user click "Approve" or "Edit."
* **Editable workflow preview**. Allow the user to review or tweak the generated workflow. For instance, show generated code snippets or a step-by-step list. The user can accept, modify, or reject each part. If they modify, feed the changes back into the agent loop (GPT) to regenerate any dependent parts. This keeps users in the loop and prevents blind execution of unintended actions. (This approach aligns with the Vercel AI SDK's step-by-step UI flows.)
* **Controlled execution after approval**. Only after explicit user approval should the agent finalize and deploy the workflow. Once approved, the system can proceed with actual code deployment or scheduling. Use the same OpenAI function-calling pattern in "Intent" mode to wait for the user's signal before executing critical operations. For example, "Ready to run this workflow? Confirm to continue." If denied, abort or allow editing.

## 5. Audit Logging and Monitoring

* **Log all interactions and outputs**. Record the entire chain of events in the database: the original user prompt, each GPT plan and code output, API calls made, and user approvals. Use Prisma to insert log records into an `AuditLogs` table after each step. Include timestamps, user IDs, prompt text, function call arguments, and GPT responses. This trace will be crucial for debugging and accountability.
* **Use Prisma audit techniques**. Since Prisma lacks built-in audit trails, consider middleware or triggers to automate logging. For example, use a Prisma middleware extension or database triggers to capture inserts/updates to workflow tables. One can create trigger functions that write changes into a log table, ensuring all writes are recorded. The [Prisma Audit Trail Guide] outlines using triggers or middleware for this purpose.
* **Monitor prompt logs for abuse**. Implement a logging system for LLM inputs/outputs for security monitoring. Regularly scan the stored prompts and GPT responses for signs of prompt injection or misuse (see Security below). As Datadog recommends, "monitor prompts via request logs and/or prompt traces" to detect suspicious patterns. Set up alerts or manual reviews for log entries that contain red-flag keywords or unusual activity.

## 6. Security and Misuse Mitigation

* **Input validation and sanitization**. Pre-process user goals to strip disallowed content (e.g. malicious code snippets) before feeding them to GPT. Enforce a whitelist of allowed operations: the agent may only call APIs defined in the loaded OpenAPI specs. Never allow arbitrary code execution beyond the vetted functions. This limits the surface for prompt injection.
* **Guardrail checks**. Run parallel "guardrail" agents or filters on GPT outputs. For example, after GPT generates code or a plan, pass it through a moderation LLM (or regex checks) to remove dangerous commands (e.g. SSH calls, deleting data). As recommended for agentic systems, use guardrails in tandem with agents to ensure safety and alignment. These guardrails can also classify the user's intent to catch off-scope requests.
* **Rate limits and permissions**. Impose sensible limits on how many operations an agent can perform per request, and require user authentication for any actions that touch private APIs. Ensure all API credentials (especially for private services) are securely stored and only accessed by the server (never exposed to GPT or the client). Follow the principle of least privilege: for example, only allow the agent service role to call specific APIs it needs.
* **Content filtering on outputs**. As GPT generates text or code, run it through a filter to redact any sensitive data or improbable code. Datadog notes that "LLM chains often contain tools that moderate the response before returning it… to block or redact sensitive information". Implement such moderation to catch things like SQL injection attempts in generated queries or output of confidential info.
* **Prompt injection detection**. Protect against malicious input that tries to alter the agent's behavior. Strictly separate the system/prompt instructions (which define allowed operations) from the user prompt. For example, never append raw user text into GPT's system prompts without filtering. Use monitoring as mentioned: scan prompt logs for known "jailbreak" patterns. If detected, abort or flag the session.
* **Code review step**. Optionally include an automated "reviewer" agent that examines the generated code for vulnerabilities before final execution. For example, after the code generation phase, run GPT (or a static analysis tool) to look for insecure patterns. This mimics the multi-agent *Review* phase in pipelines where GPT-4 checks for security flaws. Any flagged issue should halt deployment until a developer intervenes.

Each stage above should be treated as an implementation milestone. For example, first **set up the environment and scaffolding** (Next.js route, Prisma models, keys); then **design the architecture** (define data models, function definitions); then **build the LLM execution pipeline** (planning prompts, code generation, chaining calls); then **create the confirmation UI** (review/approve dialog in the front end); and finally **implement logging and security** measures (audit tables, filters, guardrails). Throughout, iteratively test with simple use-cases (e.g. "Fetch weather then email summary") and refine the prompts and code templates.

**Sources:** We draw on best practices for LLM function-calling and agent design. For example, OpenAI's guides show typical function-calling flows and a "user approval" flow. Agent frameworks emphasize planning plus generation (the "assembly line" of plan→code→review) to decompose tasks. Transforming OpenAPI specs into GPT-callable functions is supported by tools like Haystack's `OpenAPIServiceToFunctions`. Security guidance (guardrails, logging, least-privilege) comes from emerging best practices in LLM deployments.
