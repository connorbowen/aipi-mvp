# Natural-Language-to-API Orchestration Platform – B2C PRD and Implementation Plan

## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### Vision and Value Proposition

We envision a consumer-focused automation tool that lets anyone describe tasks in plain language (e.g. "cancel my outdoor plans if it's raining") and have the system handle the rest. By leveraging large language models with function calling, the platform turns natural language into API workflows. This aligns with the trend of *natural language interfaces*, which remove friction and lower the learning curve by adapting the interface to the user. In effect, even non-technical users can automate tasks without needing to write code, thanks to a **no-code paradigm** where the system hides the technical details behind an intuitive interface. For example, automating repetitive tasks has been shown to "free up valuable time to focus on meaningful activities" and empowers everyday users by giving them the ability to build solutions without waiting for a developer. Our platform's value proposition is to *democratize automation*: empower the general public to easily connect public APIs (weather, calendar, maps, etc.) to their daily needs through simple conversation, following the no-code ethos of "literally anyone can build it". The freemium model will give free users limited usage, with paid plans for higher limits – a common SaaS strategy where free access is capped by features or quota, and upgrades unlock full functionality.

### User Personas and Use Cases

To ensure we address real needs, we define representative personas of typical users:

* **Alice – Busy Parent:** Juggles family schedules and wants to **auto-adjust plans**. (Use cases: "If rain is forecast tomorrow morning, remove our picnic from the calendar;" "Notify me if my kid's soccer practice is canceled due to weather.")
* **Bob – Small Business Owner:** Manages appointments and reminders. (Use cases: "Send me a Slack message if a high-priority sales lead books a meeting;" "If inventory for item X runs low, email me.")
* **Carol – Avid Traveler/Hiker:** Plans trips and outdoor activities. (Use cases: "Check the weather at my destination next Monday and text me if it's expected to storm;" "Remind me to pack sunscreen when it's sunny.")
* **Dan – Fitness Enthusiast:** Coordinates workouts with weather/health data. (Use cases: "Schedule outdoor runs only on days below 75°F;" "Log my runs to Strava and notify me if air quality is poor.")
* **Eve – Senior User:** Prefers simple reminders and alerts. (Use cases: "Remind me 10 minutes before my afternoon walk if it's dry outside;" "Cancel my garden watering schedule on rainy days.")

These personas guide design and ensure our features (e.g. weather integration, calendar access, messaging) serve concrete scenarios. We will also create use-case examples and templates (empty-state guidance) so new users immediately see relevant tasks to try, reducing confusion.

### Feature List (MVP Scope)

The MVP will include these core capabilities:

* **Natural Language Interface:** A simple text (or voice) chat where users describe what they want in everyday language (no commands or code). The system uses OpenAI function-calling to interpret the request and plan calls.
* **Curated API Catalog:** Pre-selected, consumer-friendly APIs (e.g. weather forecast, map/location, calendar, contacts, email/SMS) available out-of-the-box. Users can "bring their own" by entering API endpoints or keys if desired (advanced mode). The platform ingests each API's OpenAPI spec to know its functions and parameters.
* **Workflow Definition (Trigger/Logic/Action):** Users can express conditions and actions in one go. For example, "If it's raining tomorrow, cancel my outdoor event." Under the hood this becomes a trigger (weather API check), an optional filter (rainy condition), and an action (modify calendar). No-code tools often use this *trigger→logic→action* model; we will allow such chains via conversation.
* **Confirmation and Preview:** Before executing any multi-step workflow, the system displays the interpreted plan in human-readable form (e.g. numbered steps "1. Check weather API. 2. If it's raining, update your calendar."). The user confirms or edits it, adding a safety check (balancing automation with fallback).
* **Starter Templates & Guidance:** On first use or empty state, show example queries and guided wizards ("Try saying: 'Send me a daily morning briefing'") to inspire users. Provide tooltips and interactive tips to clarify how to phrase tasks.
* **User Account with Freemium Limits:** Free-tier accounts get a limited number of workflows or API calls per month (e.g. 100 requests). Paid plans unlock higher quotas (both in volume and/or API variety). This follows standard SaaS freemium practice: free access with usage limits and feature caps.
* **Multi-Portal Support:** The system architecture will support separate deployments or branded portals (one for consumers, one for business users) so the product can be tailored (e.g. enterprise users might get more advanced APIs or higher limits).

### User Experience Requirements

* **Intuitive Conversational UI:** The main interface is a chat box or smart form. Users type queries in plain English. The UI uses simple language, placeholders ("What would you like to automate?"), and avoids jargon.
* **Guided Onboarding:** New users see a clean welcome screen explaining the value ("Automate everyday tasks by just telling us what to do"), with a quick start example. We avoid asking for logins or permissions until necessary (apps should not request access without context). Empty-state screens and walkthrough tips will reduce friction. Good onboarding is vital – studies show ~25% of users abandon an app after first use if it's confusing.
* **Minimal Friction:** We will not expose raw API tokens or require coding steps for average users. Any required configuration (like connecting a Google Calendar) should use familiar OAuth dialogs, only when needed. Optional "advanced mode" can allow technical users to enter custom API keys or modify JSON parameters. In general, the user experience should be as seamless as a chatbot or smart assistant.
* **Clear Error Messages and Help:** If the AI cannot parse a request or an API fails, we'll provide human-friendly feedback ("Sorry, I couldn't understand. Did you mean X or Y?"). We'll offer quick retry or alternative suggestions. Each step's success or failure will be reported clearly.
* **Responsive and Accessible:** The front end should be mobile-friendly and fast (typical web or PWA stack). UI elements and text will follow accessibility best practices (legible text, high contrast, screen-reader labels). Voice input may be an optional enhancement (not MVP).
* **Privacy and Trust:** We will clearly explain any data use (e.g. "This app will check weather using your location. It only stores your preferences and logs anonymized data"). Collect only necessary personal info. For example, asking for location or calendar access only when the user tries a related task builds trust.
* **Personalization:** Allow each user to set preferences (e.g. default units or location) to improve relevance. Provide a simple dashboard where users see their remaining free quota ("You have 20 free queries left this month" to encourage upgrades).

### Data Models

Key data entities include:

* **User Account:** Stores user ID, contact info, plan level (free/pro), usage counters (API calls, workflows run). Also OAuth tokens for external services if granted (encrypted in the database).
* **API Catalog:** Each API integration has metadata (name, description, category tags) and a parsed OpenAPI spec (endpoints and parameter schemas). We store a normalized representation of each function (for example, a table of "Function name", input parameters, description) so the AI can use them.
* **Workflow Definition:** Each user-created workflow (even one-off tasks) is stored as a structured plan: trigger conditions, action steps, parameters, schedule/timing. This allows retries or auditing.
* **Audit Logs:** Detailed logs of user requests, AI-decoded actions, API calls made (including parameters), and results. Each log entry includes timestamp and user ID. Sensitive fields (like API keys or personal data) are omitted or masked.
* **Usage Records:** A ledger of API calls or function calls per user, used for enforcing quotas and billing.
* **Templates/Examples:** Predefined workflows (as JSON or NL) used to seed the UI for guidance.
* **Error Reports:** Records of failed workflow attempts (exception, stack trace, etc.) for engineering debugging (kept separately from user-facing logs).

### Edge Cases and Risks

* **Ambiguous Language:** Users may phrase requests unclearly or omit details (e.g. "tomorrow" without context, or "meeting" when multiple exist). The AI might misinterpret intent. We must design clarification prompts (e.g. "I found multiple events named X – which one did you mean?"). Handling varied phrasing is a known challenge for NLP interfaces, so we will train prompts and include fallback questions.
* **LLM Hallucinations:** The AI could attempt to call a function that doesn't exist or return nonsense. We mitigate by strictly limiting function definitions to our known API list, and double-checking AI output schema before executing. Unexpected outputs will trigger a safe error ("I'm sorry, I don't understand that request").
* **API Failures:** External APIs can be unavailable or return errors (rate limits, network issues). The platform must gracefully report such failures ("Weather service unavailable, please try again") and not crash. It should also retry transient errors or use cached data if appropriate.
* **Privacy and Security:** If connecting to private data (e.g. personal calendar, contacts), we must ensure the user explicitly authorizes it (via OAuth) and encrypt tokens. Logs and AI prompts should never reveal sensitive content back to other users. We will mask or avoid logging sensitive fields (per best practice).
* **Excessive Usage / Abuse:** Bots or malicious users might try to spam the service (e.g. automate the automations). Rate limiting (below) will help, but we must also detect abuse patterns. For example, if a free user registers many accounts or fires off high-volume queries, we may require email/phone verification or temporarily suspend.
* **Legal/Compliance:** Some APIs have terms (e.g. no scrapers). We must enforce only allowed actions (for instance, preventing use of email/SMS APIs for spam). User-provided custom APIs are the user's responsibility, but we will flag obviously disallowed content (e.g. prohibited content filters for texts).
* **Free-Tier Limits:** Users hitting the free quota should see a friendly notice ("You've reached your free limit this month"). We must ensure the system enforces quotas reliably (avoid hidden overages). We'll also monitor for "credit stuffing" attacks where users exceed the free tier by loopholes – rate limiting and account checks will help.
* **UI Complexity Creep:** There is a risk the product becomes too complex for non-technical users (e.g. too many settings). We will guard against feature-bloat: advanced options will be hidden by default, and the interface will guide novices through only what they need.

## Implementation Plan

### Technical Architecture

The system will be a cloud-based, microservice-oriented architecture:

* **Frontend Web/Mobile:** A single-page app (e.g. React or Flutter) for the chat interface, examples carousel, and settings. It communicates via REST/GraphQL APIs to the backend.
* **Backend API Server:** Manages user accounts, sessions, and orchestrates flows. Likely implemented in a robust framework (e.g. Node.js/Express or Python/Flask). This service handles authentication, serves the catalog UI, and records usage.
* **Language Model Orchestrator:** A service that interacts with OpenAI's API. It takes user input plus relevant function schemas (from our API catalog) and calls OpenAI's chat/completion endpoint with `function_call="auto"`. Based on the AI's response (which may include a function call JSON), the orchestrator then executes the actual API call. We will use OpenAI's function calling feature, which "allows AI models to dynamically call external functions or APIs in response to user queries". Essentially, our orchestrator defines the JSON schema (derived from OpenAPI specs) for each possible function and lets the model pick and fill them.
* **Execution Engine / Task Queue:** For multi-step or scheduled workflows, we will push tasks into a queue (e.g. Redis Queue, Celery, or AWS Lambda). This ensures steps can run asynchronously (and retry on failure). For example, a condition check might happen in the morning, then trigger an action.
* **Database:** A durable store (e.g. PostgreSQL or managed cloud DB) for users, workflows, and records. We may also use a NoSQL store for logging or caching.
* **API Catalog Service:** A component responsible for ingesting OpenAPI specs. Admins or users submit an OpenAPI URL/JSON; this service validates it (using an OpenAPI parser), extracts endpoints and parameter definitions, and stores them. It also generates the JSON schema objects (name, parameters, descriptions) passed to the LLM.
* **Logging & Monitoring:** A logging pipeline (e.g. ELK stack or cloud logging) to collect structured logs and metrics. We'll use centralized logging so that all service components write to a common log store for debugging and audit. Error monitoring (e.g. Sentry) will capture exceptions.
* **Infrastructure:** Deployed on a cloud provider (AWS/GCP/Azure) for scalability. Services will run in containers or serverless functions behind load balancers. We will auto-scale stateless components (API servers, orchestrator workers) based on CPU or request rate. Databases will use managed replicas and read-replicas for load.

### Authentication and Usage Metering

* **User Authentication:** Support email/password or SSO for convenience. Users authenticate to manage their automations. Third-party OAuth is used to connect external services (e.g. "Sign in with Google" to access Google Calendar or Gmail). OAuth tokens are stored encrypted in the user's profile. For premium/business accounts, integrate a payment system (e.g. Stripe) to handle upgrades.
* **API Credentials:** For curated APIs (weather, etc.) we'll provide built-in API keys on the backend so users don't see them. If advanced users bring their own APIs, we allow them to enter their API keys or secrets via a secure form. These are encrypted and only sent server-to-server during calls.
* **Usage Tracking:** Each user's actions are metered. We count a "usage unit" as an API call (or function call) or a complete workflow run, depending on policy. The backend increments counters in the database. For example, calling the weather API once might be one unit. Free-tier quotas (e.g. 100 units/month) are enforced by checking this count before execution. Overages prompt a "limit reached" response and an upgrade notice. This mimics common SaaS patterns where users must upgrade after free quotas are exceeded.
* **Plan Enforcement:** The system will have plan configurations (free, pro, business) that define limits (requests per day/month, number of workflows, number of user seats, etc.). On each request, middleware checks the user's current usage against their plan.
* **Anti-Fraud Measures:** To prevent gaming free tiers, we will verify emails at signup and possibly require a credit card for business accounts. Unusual activity (e.g. many requests in a short span) will trigger throttling or a CAPTCHA challenge. For example, the Stytch blog notes free-tier abuse (multiple accounts/scripts) as a risk without rate limits.

### OpenAPI Ingestion and API Catalog Management

* **Catalog Database:** We maintain a table of API integrations. Each record includes name, description, category tags, and status (active/test).
* **Spec Parsing:** When adding a new API (curated or user-provided), we fetch its OpenAPI JSON/YAML and parse it (using an OpenAPI library). We extract all operations (endpoints) and parameters, and create a list of function descriptors. For example, a weather API endpoint `/current?city={city}` becomes a function `getCurrentWeather(city)`. We store these function definitions (name, parameter schema, description) in the catalog database.
* **Function Schema Generation:** For each function, we generate the JSON schema that will be sent to OpenAI. This schema aligns with OpenAI's function-calling format (fields: `name`, `description`, `parameters.type=object`, etc.).
* **User Selection and Whitelisting:** The UI will let users choose which APIs to enable in their account. Only functions from enabled APIs are passed to the LLM when interpreting requests. By default, free users get the core set (weather, etc.), while premium/business can unlock more (or upload their own).
* **Versioning and Updates:** We'll track the version of each API spec. If an API updates, an admin or automated job can re-ingest the new spec. Existing workflows using that API should be checked for compatibility.
* **Monitoring:** Periodically test each API in the catalog (especially curated ones) for availability and latency, marking any broken ones for review.

### Workflow Planning, Confirmation, and Execution Flows

1. **Natural Language Input:** The user enters a request. The backend logs this input.
2. **Prompt Construction:** The orchestrator service builds a prompt to OpenAI. This includes the user's text, plus the list of available function schemas (from enabled APIs) and any context (user preferences). We use GPT-4/GPT-3.5 with function-calling enabled, letting the model choose the appropriate function and arguments.
3. **Function Identification:** OpenAI returns a message indicating which function to call and with which JSON arguments (or it returns a text response if no API call is needed). This effectively *plans* the workflow. For multi-step tasks, we may loop: if the first call's response triggers another function call, we send a follow-up prompt.
4. **Plan Display:** Before running any real actions (especially if it will change user data or external records), we format the planned steps into human language and show it to the user (e.g. "Step 1: Get tomorrow's weather. Step 2: If rain, remove event from calendar."). This addresses the requirement for user confirmation. The user can approve or cancel.
5. **Execution:** Upon confirmation, the system executes each step sequentially. For each function call returned by the AI, we translate it into an actual HTTP/API call to the external service. We pass along any necessary authentication (like OAuth tokens). We capture the response. If any step fails (non-200 status or error), we abort the workflow and report the error.
6. **Result and Logging:** After execution, we present the outcome ("Done – your meeting was cancelled!" or an error explanation). All inputs, AI outputs, and API responses are logged in the audit trail. Success/failure codes are recorded.
7. **Follow-Up & Scheduled Tasks:** If the user's request implied a future trigger (e.g. "Tomorrow morning at 8 AM, if it rains, cancel my plan"), we schedule the workflow execution via a job scheduler. The data model for workflows includes timing so that on the trigger time, the above flow repeats.

OpenAI's function-calling makes step 3 straightforward: as Globant's guide notes, the model can *"retrieve real-time data, trigger workflow, or even control devices"* by calling defined functions. We rely on that by mapping each API endpoint to an OpenAI function.

### Audit Logging and Error Reporting

* **Structured Logs:** All requests and actions generate structured logs (JSON). Each log entry includes: user ID, timestamp, request text, interpreted function calls, parameters, and outcomes (status and data). We include the HTTP method and endpoint for each API call. Sensitive information (like OAuth tokens or personal messages) is masked or omitted.
* **Levels and Centralization:** Logs are categorized by level (INFO, ERROR, DEBUG). Critical errors (uncaught exceptions) are reported via an error-tracking service (e.g. Sentry) with stack traces (in dev logs only). We use a centralized log store or logging service so engineers can search and trace issues across services.
* **Audit Trails:** For compliance and debugging, the system keeps an immutable audit trail of every action that changed user state (e.g. calendar updates, messages sent) with who, when, and what. This helps answer "what happened" if users ask. We will retain logs according to policy (e.g. 90 days) and archive older logs.
* **Monitoring and Alerts:** The system exposes metrics (request rate, error rate, latency) to a monitoring dashboard (Prometheus/Grafana or cloud equivalent). Alerts are set up for abnormal conditions (e.g. high failure rate on an API or sudden usage spike).
* **Masking PII:** As DreamFactory advises, we will not log plaintext personal data. For example, if an event title or user's email address is part of an action, we log only its ID or a hash. This keeps logs useful but compliant.

### Rate Limiting, Abuse Prevention, and Scaling

* **Rate Limiting:** We will enforce rate limits at multiple levels. Each user (or API key) will have a maximum requests-per-minute and per-hour. This prevents any single user from consuming all capacity. For example, free users might be limited to 10 actions/minute. If a user exceeds this, further requests are throttled with a "please wait" message. Rate limiting also protects against bots and DDoS: as Stytch explains, "API rate limiting is a frontline defense against … DoS attacks".
* **Fair Usage:** By capping individual usage, we ensure fair access: no user can monopolize APIs or our servers. This also guards against the classic "rush hour" scenario, keeping the system responsive for everyone.
* **Abuse Detection:** In addition to static limits, we monitor behavioral signals. Rapid-fire repeating patterns, account cloning, or anomalous geolocation changes trigger challenges (CAPTCHA or temporary blocks). Free-tier misuse (e.g. someone creating many accounts to escape limits) is mitigated by email/phone verification. The Stytch guide warns that without such controls, users may "create multiple accounts or use automated scripts to exceed limits" – we will guard against that.
* **Scalability:** To support growth, the architecture is designed for horizontal scaling. Stateless components (web servers, orchestrators) run behind auto-scaling groups. Databases will be scaled vertically/with replicas as needed. We will use caching (e.g. Redis or in-memory) for common data (like public API responses such as weather) to reduce load. Load balancers distribute traffic. We'll regularly load-test the system to find bottlenecks. As user numbers grow, we can shard or partition by region/tenant.
* **Cloud Services:** We may use managed cloud services for heavy lifting. For example, a managed message queue for tasks, and managed Kubernetes or serverless functions for compute. This allows on-demand scaling during spikes.
* **Backup and Redundancy:** Critical data (user info, logs) will be backed up regularly. We will deploy across availability zones to survive outages.

By combining rate limiting, thorough monitoring, and on-demand scaling, the platform can prevent abuse, provide reliable service, and accommodate growth from consumer trial all the way to mass usage.
